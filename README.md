# CalmDown11
This repository contains a simple registry file that has all of the recommended settings from the program ShutUp10++. This project is for the people who would like an easy way to slow down the amount of data Windows 11 collects without relying on a closed source binary blob.

# Installation
All you need to do is download the `calmdown11.reg` file, run it as an administrator and then reboot your computer. I would recommend running it after every major update to ensure Windows 11 has not reverted any of the changes, which does happen.

# Support
This registry file is provided as-is. I highly recommend you carefully review the registry file to ensure the changes it makes are suitable for your environment.
