# CalmDown11
This repository contains a simple registry file that contains all of the recommended settings from ShutUp10++. This project is for the people who would like an easy way to slow down the amount of data Windows 11 collects without relying on a closed source binary blob.

# Installation
All you need to do is download the `calmdown11.reg` file, run it as an administrator and then reboot your computer. I would recommend running it after every major update to ensure Windows 11 has not reverted any of the changes, which does happen.

# Warranty
This is provided as-is, so use it at your own risk. I don't want to be blamed if this does cause trouble for some weird edge case configuration out there.
